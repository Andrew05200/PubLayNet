# PubLayNet

PubLayNet is a large dataset of document images, of which the layout is annotated with both bounding boxes and polygonal segmentations. The source of the documents is [PubMed Central Open Access Subset (commercial use collection)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/). The annotations are automatically generated by matching the PDF format and the XML format of the articles in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. More details are available in our paper ["PubLayNet: largest dataset ever for document layout analysis."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07836)

## Updates in progress

### Data access

The current download link (Box) only supports downloading in a browser. And we have received a few reports that the downloading speed is low in India and China. We are working on migrating the data to the [IBM Data Asset eXchange (DAX)](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/) platform, which supports aws s3 API. The dataset is under legal assessment by DAX and will be migrated soon.

### Pre-trained model

In parallel with data migration, the pre-trained Faster-RCNN and Mask-RCNN models are under legal assessment and will be released on [IBM Model Asset eXchange (MAX)](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/models/).  

### Ground truth of test set

The ground truth of test will not be release, as we want to keep it for a competition in the future. We will offer a service for people to submit and evaluate their results soon.

## Getting data

Images and annotations can be downloaded from this [Box folder](https://ibm.box.com/s/ph19ku47eahazje4caijlmnmcwa20v9o)

## Annotation format

The annotation files follows the [json format of the Object Detection task of MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data)

## Examples

A [Jupyter notebook](./examples/visualize_annotations.ipynb) is provided to generate the following visualization of the annotations of 20 sample pages.
